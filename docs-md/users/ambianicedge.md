[Ambianic Edge](https://github.com/ambianic/ambianic-edge) turns your Raspberry Pi into a smart camera device.
We recommend running Ambianic Edge on an [Ambianic Box](https://github.com/ambianic/ambianic-box) but you can also install and run it on most ARM on x86 computers.

# Easy Install

Step by step instructions for a quick install [available here](https://docs.ambianic.ai/users/installsoftware/).

Once installed and running, you can connect to an Ambianic Edge via the [UI app](https://ui.ambianic.ai/) and see a timeline of detection events.

# Advanced Install

Advanced Install and CLI access instructions [available here](https://docs.ambianic.ai/users/quickstart/#advanced-install).

# Configuration

Some configuration features are available in the UI but more advanced configuration requires logging into the Ambianic Edge device via `ssh` and editing its `config.yaml` file. [Read more](https://docs.ambianic.ai/users/configure/) about advanced configuration.

# How to run in development mode

If you are interested to try the development version, follow [this guide](https://docs.ambianic.ai/developers/development-environment/).
