# Home Assistant Integration

[Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) is one of the most popular Open Source Home Automation hubs and it is a natural integration target for Ambianic. The integration enables users to implement new home automation flows based on Ambianic detection events. For example:
* Turn on lights if a family member walks in the house and its night time.
* Trigger the alarm if an unknown person is on private property for more than 1 minute.
* Turn off the stove if no person has been detected in the house for over an hour; or
* Instantly notify family and caregivers if an elderly loved one falls.

## Notifications

The simplest way to integrate Ambianic with Home Assistant is via notifications. See [notifications config](https://docs.ambianic.ai/users/configure/#notification-settings) guide for details.

## Add-on

Ambianic can also be installed as a Home Assistant Add-on. See details [here](https://github.com/dcmartin/addon-ambianic).
