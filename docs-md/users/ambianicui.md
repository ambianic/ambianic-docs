[Ambianic UI](https://ui.ambianic.ai/) is a
modern prorgressive web application (PWA) that provides Plug-and-Play pairing and remote access
to an Ambianic Edge device.

Ambianic UI shows a timeline view with
important events around your home organized chronologically. Below is an example
timeline screenshot.

### Connecting to an Ambianic Edge device

You can easily pair up your Ambianic UI with an Ambianic Box or any other device running Ambiniac Edge. It works similar to Airdrop.

Make sure to open Ambianic UI on the same local WiFi network where Ambianic Edge runs. Ambianic UI will initially display a welcome screen.

Go to Settings and follow the steps for adding a new device.

After a few moments, pairing will conclude and you will see the unique identifier of your Ambianic Edge device. 

Give your device a unique friendly name such as Entry Area or Front Door.

You can now head to the Timeline view and you will be able to see an image of what is in front of the Ambianic Box. The box is pre-configured to detect people and cars.

The pairing information is persisted on your Ambianic UI client device and you can now access Ambianic Edge from anywhere remotely! The connection is direct and encrypted end-to-end.

When you are ready to explore more advanced capabilities, continue to the next section.

### Configuration

Ambianic provides flexible configuration options via a configuration YAML file. You can customize: pipelines, input sources, AI models, notification channels and more.
