# An Open Source Smart Camera Project

Ambianic is an [award winning](https://blog.ambianic.ai/2020/11/05/awards.html) Open Source Smart Camera project that aims to make our homes and workspaces safer by providing helpful and actionable suggestions. For example, notify family members instantly if a loved one has fallen down.

Ambianic has two major components: 

* [Ambianic Edge](users/ambianicedge): an IoT device with a camera and a built-in AI engine for on-device inference and training. Usually runs within an [Ambianic Box](users/ambianicbox) enclosure.
* [Ambianic UI](users/ambianicui): a front-end Progressive Web App to manage Ambianic Edge devices.

Following is a high level diagram of a typical Ambianic deployment.
