Below is a 5 Whys diagram that tries to provide objective answers: Needless to say there are subjective reasons which are equally if not more influential for the existence of this project such as basic human excitement to serve a bigger purpose via open source AI. User Journey Ambianic's roadmap is inspired by user stories and community feedback. The following diagram illustrates an example user journey. User journeys help us align on the bigger picture and segue into agile development constructs such as user stories and sprints. More user journeys will be added over time as the project evolves. Some of the candidate topics include: Home Automation Turn traditional door locks into smart locks with Face Recognition. Alert parents if a crying toddler is left unattended for more than 15 minutes. Raise an alert if a baby is seated near a car door without child lock enabled while in motion. Business Automation Prevent accidents by alerting drivers who act sleepy or distracted. Make sure that a factory floor position is not left unattended for more than 15 minutes. Recognize presence of unauthorized people in a restricted access work area. User - System Interactions Users interact with the system in two phases: First Time Installation Consequent App Engagements The following diagram illustrates the high level user - system interactions. User Interface Flow The User Interface is centered around three main activities: Setup Ambianic Edge to communicate with smart home devices: sensors, cameras, microphones, lights, door locks, and others. Design flows to automatically observe sensors and make helpful recommendations. Review event timeline, alerts and actionable recommendations. Ambianic UI is an Offline-First PWA (Progressive Web Application). PWAs work in any browser, but \"app-like\" with features such as being independent of connectivity, install to home screen, and push messaging depend on browser support. Ambianic UI does not assume that the user has constant broadband internet access. Its built to handle a range of real world scenarios with low bandwidth or no-Internet access at all when the user may need to review Ambianic alerts, events timeline, edit flows and configure edge devices. Ambianic UI stores data locally on the client device (mobile or desktop) and, when there\u2019s a network connection, syncs data to the user's Ambianic server and resolves any data conflicts. When possible it communicates directly with local Ambianic Edge devices minimizing network routing overhead. Product Design Goals Our goal is to build a product that is useful out of the box: Less than 15 minutes setup time Less than $75 in hardware costs Primary platform: Raspberry Pi 4 B, 4GB RAM, 32GB SDRAM No coding required to get started Decomposable and hackable for open source developers Quick Start If you would like to try the latest version, follow the steps in the Quick Start Guide . Community Support If you have questions, ideas or cool projects you'd like to share with the Ambianic team and community, please use the Ambianic Twitter channel . Contributors If you are interested in becoming a contributor to the project, please read the Contributing page and follow the steps. Looking forward to hearing from you! Sustainability \ud83c\udf31 Ambianic is 100% Open Source and funded by its user community. 100% Open Source ensures full transparency, privacy and user data ownership. By design, there are no other direct or indirect sources of funding that compromise the core values of the project. The project roadmap is open to community feedback and input. As we reach new levels of regular sponsors, we run a community survey to prioritize the next big roadmap feature.

In the section below: front_door_camera: &src_front_door_cam uri: *secret_uri_front_door_camera Replace *secret_uri_front_door_camera with your camera still image snapshot URI (recommended). For example: front_door_camera: &src_front_door_cam uri: http://192.168.86.29/cgi-bin/api.cgi?cmd=Snap&channel=0&rs=wuuPhkmUCeI9WG7C&user=admin&password=****** type: image live: true Or you can alternatively plug-in the camera video streaming RTSP URI. For example: front_door_camera: &src_front_door_cam uri: rtsp://admin:password@192.168.1.99/media/video1 type: video live: true Only use RTSP if you run high end hardware and use AI inference in your pipelines that needs video and/or audio data instead of still images. Make sure that the HTTP URI points to a valid image. You can test by simply putting the URI in your web browser. You should see a current snapshot of live camera capture. If you choose to use an RTSP URI, then you can test that with a tool like VLC . The parameter live: true indicates that this is a continuous stream without a predetermined end. Therefore Ambianic Edge should do whatever it can to continuously pull media and recover from interruptions caused by network or other glitches. Now save the file and restart the docker image. Within a few moments you should be able to see a populated timeline in the UI with fresh images from your camera and some object, people and face detections if there are any to detect. You can reference the Quick Start Guide for instructions on starting and stopping the Ambianic Edge docker image. Cameras Cameras are some of the most common sources of input data for Ambianic.ai pipelines. Ambianic.ai is typically connected to IP Network cameras, but you can also connect a local embedded web cam or USB connected camera. Connecting a local Web USB camera Ambianic.ai needs a valid URI to connect to. This requires running an app that captures video from your local camera and streams it over HTTP or RTSP. VLC is one of the most popular and easy to use apps for that. Here is how you can turn your local webcam into an IP streaming camera. The streaming URL shared by VLC is the input source URI for the Ambianic.ai configuration file. How to find the URI for your camera If you don't have experience configuring surveillance cameras, it can be tricky to find the URI. We are working on a camera Plug-and-Play feature in Ambianic to make it easier to discover and connect to your cameras. Keep an eye for release news. In the meanwhile, you have several options: First, check your camera manufacturer's documentation whether it supports still image URL over HTTP or video streaming over RTSP. Most IP cameras do, but not all. If your camera is ONVIF standard conformant, then you will have access to HTTP camera images and RTSP video stream. You can use the ONVIF Search Tool to check if your camera is listed as conformant. You can then use a tool such as ONVIF Device Manager to auto discover your IP camera and show you its RTSP and HTTP URI. Here is a quick How-To . A more detailed post on this tool is also available here . Your camera manufacturer will likely have an online resource describing how to determine its RTSP address. It would look something like this one . There is also an online directory where you can search for the RTSP URI of many camera brands. Using still image source instead of a video stream for your camera URI In many cases processing 1 frame per second is sufficient frequency to detect interesting events in your environment. It is usually more CPU and network resource efficient to use a still image source instead of live RTSP stream for 1fps. This approach allows Ambianic.ai Edge to pull from the camera another image snapshot when it is ready as opposed to streaming which pushes constantly media updates that Edge may or may not be ready to process. All you have to do to use a still image source from your camera is to locate the specific image URI as described above and plug it in the corresponding source section of the config.yaml file. Here is what it would look like: front_door_camera: &src_front_door_cam uri: http://192.168.86.29/cgi-bin/api.cgi?cmd=Snap&channel=0&rs=wuuPhkmUCeI9WG7C&user=admin&password=****** type: image live: true In the example above the URI points to a still jpg sample from the camera. Ambianic Edge will continuously poll this URI approximately once per second (1fps). Sensitive config information In the configuration example, there are a few references to variables defined elsewhere in the YAML file. You can use standard YAML anchors and aliases for that. Notice that *src_front_door_cam and *src_entry_area_cam are the YAML aliases(references) that do not appear elsewhere in config.yaml. They are actually picked up from an optional file located in the same directory: secrets.yaml . Since camera URIs often contain credentials, we recommend that you store such values in secrets.yaml . Ambianic Edge will automatically look for and if available prepend secrets.yaml to config.yaml . That way you can share config.yaml with others without compromising privacy sensitive parameters. An example valid entry in secretes.yaml for a camera URI, would look like this: secret_uri_front_door_camera: &secret_uri_front_door_camera 'rtsp://user:pass@192.168.86.111:554/Streaming/Channels/101' # add more secret entries as regular yaml mappings Other Ambianic Edge configuration settings The rest of the configuration settings are for developers and contributors. If you feel ready to dive into log files and code, you can experiement with different AI models and pipeline elements. Otherwise leave them as they are. Using AI Accelerator Ambianic Edge will use the Google Coral TPU accelerator if one is available on the system. Note: The default docker compose configuration for Ambianic Edge checks whether a USB attached Coral is running on /dev/bus/usb . You may need to adjust that if the TPU is attached to a different file system directory. Coral is a powerful TPU that can speed up inference 5-10 times. However AI inference is only part of all the functions that execute in an Ambianic Edge pipeline. Video decoding and formatting also takes substantial amount of processing time. Overall we've seen Coral to improve performance 30-50% on a realistic Raspberry Pi 4 deployment with multiple simultaneous pipelines pulling images from multiple cameras and processing these images with multiple inference models. If you don't have a Coral device available, no need to worry for now. Raspberry Pi 4 is quite powerful. It comfortably handles 3 simultaneous HD camera sourced pipelines with approximately 1-2 frames per second (fps). An objects or person of interest would normally show up in one of your cameras for at least one second, which is enough time to be registered and processed by Ambianic Edge on a plain RPI4. Local Deployment of Ambanic UI Ambianic UI is available for FREE at ui.ambianic.ai . Its designed to be easy to use with Plug-and-play connectivity to Ambianic Edge. Secured with end-to-end encryption. Your data stays only on your own devices. However if you would like to deploy Ambianic UI on your own machine, its a straightforward process: Ambianic UI is hosted on github. It is also distributed as a Node JS npm package. If you are familiar with Node JS, you can install and run ambianic-ui from its npm distribution. Otherwise, to build from source you can follow these steps: Clone source repository git clone https://github.com/ambianic/ambianic-ui.git cd ambianic-ui Install dependencies npm install Compiles and hot-reloads for development npm run serve After a few moments you should see a message in your terminal window similar to this: App running at: - Local: http://localhost:8080/ - Network: http://192.168.86.246:8080/ Now you can access the app from your browser.","title":"Configuration"},{"location":"users/configure/#ambianic-configuration","text":"Ambianic Edge executes pipelines with input sources, AI inference models and output targets.

Here is what it would look like: front_door_camera: &src_front_door_cam uri: http://192.168.86.29/cgi-bin/api.cgi?cmd=Snap&channel=0&rs=wuuPhkmUCeI9WG7C&user=admin&password=****** type: image live: true In the example above the URI points to a still jpg sample from the camera. Ambianic Edge will continuously poll this URI approximately once per second (1fps).","title":"Using still image source instead of a video stream for your camera URI"},{"location":"users/configure/#sensitive-config-information","text":"In the configuration example, there are a few references to variables defined elsewhere in the YAML file. You can use standard YAML anchors and aliases for that. Notice that *src_front_door_cam and *src_entry_area_cam are the YAML aliases(references) that do not appear elsewhere in config.yaml. They are actually picked up from an optional file located in the same directory: secrets.yaml . Since camera URIs often contain credentials, we recommend that you store such values in secrets.yaml . Ambianic Edge will automatically look for and if available prepend secrets.yaml to config.yaml . That way you can share config.yaml with others without compromising privacy sensitive parameters. An example valid entry in secretes.yaml for a camera URI, would look like this: secret_uri_front_door_camera: &secret_uri_front_door_camera 'rtsp://user:pass@192.168.86.111:554/Streaming/Channels/101' # add more secret entries as regular yaml mappings","title":"Sensitive config information"},{"location":"users/configure/#other-ambianic-edge-configuration-settings","text":"The rest of the configuration settings are for developers and contributors.

Otherwise leave them as they are.","title":"Other Ambianic Edge configuration settings"},{"location":"users/configure/#using-ai-accelerator","text":"Ambianic Edge will use the Google Coral TPU accelerator if one is available on the system. Note: The default docker compose configuration for Ambianic Edge checks whether a USB attached Coral is running on /dev/bus/usb . You may need to adjust that if the TPU is attached to a different file system directory. Coral is a powerful TPU that can speed up inference 5-10 times. However AI inference is only part of all the functions that execute in an Ambianic Edge pipeline. Video decoding and formatting also takes substantial amount of processing time. Overall we've seen Coral to improve performance 30-50% on a realistic Raspberry Pi 4 deployment with multiple simultaneous pipelines pulling images from multiple cameras and processing these images with multiple inference models. If you don't have a Coral device available, no need to worry for now. Raspberry Pi 4 is quite powerful. It comfortably handles 3 simultaneous HD camera sourced pipelines with approximately 1-2 frames per second (fps). An objects or person of interest would normally show up in one of your cameras for at least one second, which is enough time to be registered and processed by Ambianic Edge on a plain RPI4.","title":"Using AI Accelerator"},{"location":"users/configure/#local-deployment-of-ambanic-ui","text":"Ambianic UI is available for FREE at ui.ambianic.ai .
