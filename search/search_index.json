Ambianic's mission is to make our homes and workspaces a little cozier by providing helpful and actionable suggestions. For example, notify family and caregivers instantly if a loved one has fallen down. Ambianic is an Open Source Ambient Intelligence platform that puts user privacy and local control first. It enables users to share and train custom AI models without compromising privacy. Try it Now | View on Github Home | Blog | Twitter | LinkedIn | YouTube Project background and motivation This blog post covers the initial use case and motivation behind the project: Cut The Cloud Strings Attached to Plug-and-Play Surveillance Cameras This WebRTCHacks article goes deeper into the technical design decisions for the project: Private Home Surveillance with the WebRTC DataChannel The 5 Whys What's the root cause for Ambianic.ai to exist? Below is a 5 Whys diagram that tries to provide objective answers: Needless to say there are subjective reasons which are equally if not more influential for the existence of this project such as basic human excitement to serve a bigger purpose via open source AI. User Journey Ambianic's roadmap is inspired by user stories and community feedback. The following diagram illustrates an example user journey. User journeys help us align on the bigger picture and segue into agile development constructs such as user stories and sprints. More user journeys will be added over time as the project evolves. Some of the candidate topics include: Home Automation Assist with remote family home care by detecting falls. Turn traditional door locks into smart locks with Face Recognition. Alert parents if a crying toddler is left unattended for more than 15 minutes. Raise an alert if a baby is seated near a car door without child lock enabled while in motion. Business Automation Prevent accidents by alerting drivers who act sleepy or distracted. Make sure that a factory floor position is not left unattended for more than 15 minutes. Recognize presence of unauthorized people in a restricted access work area. User - System Interactions Users interact with the system in two phases: First Time Installation Consequent App Engagements The following diagram illustrates the high level user - system interactions. User Interface Flow The User Interface is centered around three main activities: Setup Ambianic Edge to communicate with smart home devices: sensors, cameras, microphones, lights, door locks, and others. Design flows to automatically observe sensors and make helpful recommendations. Review event timeline, alerts and actionable recommendations. Ambianic UI is an Offline-First PWA (Progressive Web Application). PWAs work in any browser, but \"app-like\" with features such as being independent of connectivity, install to home screen, and push messaging depend on browser support. Ambianic UI does not assume that the user has constant broadband internet access. Its built to handle a range of real world scenarios with low bandwidth or no-Internet access at all when the user may need to review Ambianic alerts, events timeline, edit flows and configure edge devices. Ambianic UI stores data locally on the client device (mobile or desktop) and, when there\u2019s a network connection, syncs data to the user's Ambianic server and resolves any data conflicts. When possible it communicates directly with local Ambianic Edge devices minimizing network routing overhead. Product Design Goals Our goal is to build a product that is useful out of the box: [x] Less than $55 in hardware costs. Get Ambianic Box . [x] Less than 15 minutes setup time. Get RPI Image .

DYI folks and developers who love the ultimate control and flexibility of an Open Source privacy preserving surveillance solution. 2. End users who love the concept of a no nonsense privacy preserving solution to help care for their household and remote family members. User group 1 (i.e. cohort) cares more about freedom to fork, hack and integrate the code any way they like with any other systems they want to. This group is about 2% of all people who have been involved in some capacity with Ambianic.ai. User group 2, doesn't have the skills, time or plain interest to get messy with integrating an AI component with an existing camera system. They would rather buy a new turn-key intelligent camera up to $200. If they had an old camera installed (presumably a $50-100 investment), they would rather return it and replace with the a new one or simply donate it to a charity. If the old camera has been used more than 6 months, then its a depreciated asset that served its purpose and can be now written off. $100 is generally a tolerable pain threshold as compared to spending hours on integration or hiring an expert to do the work, which would cost much more than a new drop-in replacement. Both user groups are important to the long term success of the project. User Group 1 is vital, because these are the kinds of folks who can thoroughly dissect the software and offer valuable constructive criticism, contribute code, docs and in the future help grow the core team. User Group 2, the remaining 98%, is obviously vital, because these are the majority of end users who we ultimately aim to provide value to. Just to be clear, Ambianic.ai is primarily focused on adding tangible value to real users today. The fact that its open source does not contradict the primary goal in any way. Open Source is meant to enforce its validity of true value by removing proprietary layers of obscurity and superficial flashy claims. As a high level roadmap decision, we are moving forward by acknowledging that both User Group 1 and 2 are important and the project should proceed in a way that doesn't lock out either one from participating. To that extend, Luca Capra (one of our new team members) summarized the way forward better than I could: I am convinced that every niche expect and deserve a specific UX. I think the core could be flexible enough to support generic functionalities while delegating domain specific challenges to a vertical application. This could happen through different layers of integrations, eventually reusable. An example could be an object detection pipeline for training and execution, adapted to home care but also to security. Same functional perimeter but with different specializations based on user requirements Here is a high level architecture diagram of the Ambianic Edge component that we will use as a North Star reference. ) Following sections discuss further the high level architecture of the product. Ambianic High Level Architecture Pipelines Pipe Elements Sources Outputs Connecting Pipelines Integrations Ambianic's main goal is to observe the environment and provide helpful suggestions in the context of home and business automation. The user has complete ownership and control of Ambianic's input sensors, AI inference flows and processed data storage. All logic executes on user's own edge devices and data is stored only on these devices with optional backup on a user designated server. The main unit of work is the Ambianic pipeline which executes in the runtime of Ambianic Edge devices. The following diagram illustrates an example pipeline which takes as input a video stream URI source such as a surveillance camera and outputs object detections to a local directory. st=>start: Video Source op_obj=>operation: Object Detection AI op_sav1=>parallel: Storage Element io1=>inputoutput: save object detections to file op_face=>operation: Face Detection AI op_sav2=>parallel: Storage Element io2=>inputoutput: save face detections to file e=>end: Output to other pipelines st->op_obj op_obj(bottom)->op_sav1 op_sav1(path1, bottom)->op_face op_sav1(path2, right)->io1 op_face(bottom)->op_sav2 op_sav2(path1, bottom)->e op_sav2(path2, right)->io2 $(\".diagram\").flowchart(); Configuration Here is the corresponding configuration section for the pipeline above (normally located in config.yaml ): pipelines: daytime_front_door_watch: - source: rtsp://user:pass@192.168.86.111:554/Streaming/Channels/101 - detect_objects: # run ai inference on the input data model: tflite: ai_models/mobilenet_ssd_v2_coco_quant_postprocess.tflite edgetpu: ai_models/mobilenet_ssd_v2_coco_quant_postprocess_edgetpu.tflite labels: ai_models/coco_labels.txt confidence_threshold: 0.8 - save_detections: # save samples from the inference results output_directory: ./data/detections/front-door/objects positive_interval: 2 # how often (in seconds) to save samples with ANY results above the confidence threshold idle_interval: 6000 # how often (in seconds) to save samples with NO results above the confidence threshold - detect_faces: # run ai inference on the samples from the previous element output model: tflite: ai_models/mobilenet_ssd_v2_coco_quant_postprocess.tflite edgetpu: ai_models/mobilenet_ssd_v2_face_quant_postprocess_edgetpu.tflite labels: ai_models/coco_labels.txt confidence_threshold: 0.8 - save_detections: # save samples from the inference results output_directory: ./data/detections/front-door/faces positive_interval: 2 idle_interval: 600 Architectural Decomposition The following slides provide an alternative perspective on the Ambianic Edge architecture.","title":"High Level System Architecture"},{"location":"developers/architecture/#user-personas","text":"There are two major types of user personas we see in our community: 1.

If you plan to push your own code you should fork the original github repository and work from your local copy/fork. In order to take advantage of the CI workflow of the upstream repo on github, you will need to rename the master (or main ) branch of your fork to fork-master (or fork-main ). This will allow all steps of the CI to execute except for the release steps. In effect allowing you to ensure that your forked main branch passes all checks before submitting a pull request against the upstream repo. If you keep your fork's master branch name unchanged, the github workflow CI will fail. That is because when you commit against your main branch, the CI will run and will also try to publish a release on success. This will fail, since your fork does not have the release publishing keys. Alternatively if you do not want to rename your master/main branch, you can create development branches, commit all changes and initiate Pull Requests from these branches. For example create branch dev-feature-123 for a new feature you intend to contribute. Commit your changes to it and then submit pull requests from there to the upstream repo's master/main branch. Gitpod Continuous Development Environment The easiest way to start a development environment for Ambianic Edge and Ambianic UI is to use the Gitpod Continuous Development Environment. Gitpod is an All-in-browser Continuous Development Environment with user experience similar to VS Code, but running in a virtual cloud container instead of your local machine. We maintain a Gitpod configuration preset for Ambianic Edge and Ambianic UI as part of the upstream git repository, which makes it as easy as a single click to launch a fully configured and ready to use dev environment. Gitpod offers Free No Limits Professional Open Source accounts to qualifying projects maintainers. If you have not used Gitpod before, go ahead and give it a try . You can launch your gitpod space for your forked repo in one of two ways: Point your browser to an URL composed of the gitpod web app prefix and your forked repo URL. For example: https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/MY_GITHUB_ACCOUNT/ambianic-edge Alternatively, using the Gitpod browser extension , just hit the green gitpod button on your fork's main page: When your gitpod space starts for your repo, in the background it will install all the required dependencies, pre-commit hooks and other environment settings required to build, run and test the project. You can focus on writing, testing and committing your new code. You can study the gitpod config file ( .gitpod.yml ) located at the root of your repo for details on the virtual dev environment setup steps. Once your gitpod space starts it will automatically open and run the main modules for the project. You will also see a terminal running the full testsuite to ensure that you environment is in good shape and ready for coding. Ambianic Edge with Gitpod Once your gitpod space for your Ambianic Edge fork is launched, you will see several shell terminals automatically open and run the main modules that Ambinic Edge is composed of: 1. Core sensor monitoring and inference engine. 2. OpenAPI server (fastapi/uvicorn) 3. Peer-to-peer proxy (HTTP over WebRTC) You will also see a terminal running the full testsuite to ensure that you environment is in good shape and ready for coding. Screenshots examples for each terminal window follow: Ambianic Edge gitpod space automatically runs the full testsuite in a terminal window. Gitpod terminal running the Ambianic Edge Core monitoring and inference engine Gitpod terminal running fastapi/uvicorn serving the Ambianic Edge REST API (OpenAPI compliant) Gitpod terminal running WebRTC-HTTP Proxy which allows Ambianic UI to connect to this Ambianic Edge instance Ambianic Edge Dev Configuration The Ambainic Edge instance running in your gitpod space is configured by the dev-config.yaml file located in the dev directory of your workspace. If you want to modify the dev config and test with custom settings, you should add dev-config.yaml to your .gitignore file to ensure that you will not commit it back to the upstream repo. Notice that the default dev-config.yaml file is setup to use a local video file as input source to the AI pipelines. recorded_cam_feed: # location of the recorded video file in a gitpod (or local) dev environment uri: file:///workspace/ambianic-edge/tests/pipeline/avsource/test2-cam-person1.mkv type: video # live: true when we want the pipeline to keep looping over the same video file. # live: false when we want the pipeline to go through the video file once and stop. live: false This configuration allows you to simulate a realistic Ambianic Edge deployment without connecting to a live camera feed. You can change the source to use video file recordings of your choice. Unit Testing Ambianic Edge We use pytest to drive the Ambianic Edge testsuite. To run the full testsuite, you can go to the terminal window that runs it on launch and manually repeate the command: python3 -m pytest -v --log-cli-level=DEBUG --cov=ambianic --cov-report=term tests/ This runs all tests and prints a coverage report in the terminal. Also shows in the terminal all log messages logged by the tested code. You can use the pytest \"-k\" option to run selected tests. See the official pytest docs for other ways to run selected tests. Ambianic UI with Gitpod Once your gitpod space for your Ambianic UI fork is launched, you will see several shell terminals open and run: Ambinic PWA nodejs service. Gitpod will prompt you to open a browser tab for the PWA. Browser-sync service which allows you to open in a browser window static files from the project directories. You will also see another shell terminal running the full testsuite to ensure that you environment is in good shape and ready for coding. Screenshots examples for each terminal window follow: Ambianic UI gitpod space automatically runs the full testsuite in a terminal window. Terminal window running the Ambianic PWA as a nodejs service in dev mode. Terminal window running browser-sync. Unit testing Ambianic UI We use Jest for unit testing and Cypress for e2e testing. To run tests, go to the terminal that runs all tests when the gitpod space launches. Then you can Run all tests with npm run test Run unit tests with npm run test:unit Run e2e tests with npm run test:e2e Unit tests are located under tests/unit E2E tests are located under cypress/integration/ambianic-tests Local Development Environment Setting up a local dev environment tends to be more work as compared to Gitpod as it takes away compute resources from your workstation and it requires maintaining multiple virtual environments and containers along with developent tools for different language platforms. As the project evolves, it usually requires some local upkeep to make sure all local tools are up to date and in sync with the latest versions used for the current project build. If this is your preferred method, the following guidleninces are for you. Setting Up Ambianic Edge on a Local Worsktation To setup the dev environment for Ambianic Edge on your local machine you need as prerequisites: a *nix machine also in VM docker git Clone or fork the repository at https://github.com/ambianic/ambianic-edge Now open a terminal and move to the ambianic-edge folder.

If you plan to push your own code you should fork the original github repository and work from your local copy/fork. In order to take advantage of the CI workflow of the upstream repo on github, you will need to rename the master (or main ) branch of your fork to fork-master (or fork-main ). This will allow all steps of the CI to execute except for the release steps. In effect allowing you to ensure that your forked main branch passes all checks before submitting a pull request against the upstream repo. If you keep your fork's master branch name unchanged, the github workflow CI will fail. That is because when you commit against your main branch, the CI will run and will also try to publish a release on success. This will fail, since your fork does not have the release publishing keys. Alternatively if you do not want to rename your master/main branch, you can create development branches, commit all changes and initiate Pull Requests from these branches. For example create branch dev-feature-123 for a new feature you intend to contribute. Commit your changes to it and then submit pull requests from there to the upstream repo's master/main branch.","title":"Development Environment"},{"location":"developers/development-environment/#gitpod-continuous-development-environment","text":"The easiest way to start a development environment for Ambianic Edge and Ambianic UI is to use the Gitpod Continuous Development Environment.

We maintain a Gitpod configuration preset for Ambianic Edge and Ambianic UI as part of the upstream git repository, which makes it as easy as a single click to launch a fully configured and ready to use dev environment. Gitpod offers Free No Limits Professional Open Source accounts to qualifying projects maintainers. If you have not used Gitpod before, go ahead and give it a try . You can launch your gitpod space for your forked repo in one of two ways: Point your browser to an URL composed of the gitpod web app prefix and your forked repo URL. For example: https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/MY_GITHUB_ACCOUNT/ambianic-edge Alternatively, using the Gitpod browser extension , just hit the green gitpod button on your fork's main page: When your gitpod space starts for your repo, in the background it will install all the required dependencies, pre-commit hooks and other environment settings required to build, run and test the project. You can focus on writing, testing and committing your new code. You can study the gitpod config file ( .gitpod.yml ) located at the root of your repo for details on the virtual dev environment setup steps.

In the section below: front_door_camera: uri: <your camera> Replace <your camera> with your camera still image snapshot URI (recommended). For example: front_door_camera: uri: http://192.168.86.29/cgi-bin/api.cgi?cmd=Snap&channel=0&rs=wuuPhkmUCeI9WG7C&user=admin&password=****** type: image live: true Or you can alternatively plug-in the camera video streaming RTSP URI. For example: front_door_camera: uri: rtsp://admin:password@192.168.1.99/media/video1 type: video live: true Only use RTSP if you run high end hardware and use AI inference in your pipelines that needs video and/or audio data instead of still images. Make sure that the HTTP URI points to a valid image. You can test by simply putting the URI in your web browser. You should see a current snapshot of live camera capture. If you choose to use an RTSP URI, then you can test that with a tool like VLC . The parameter live: true indicates that this is a continuous stream without a predetermined end. Therefore Ambianic Edge should do whatever it can to continuously pull media and recover from interruptions caused by network or other glitches. Now save the file and restart the docker image. Within a few moments you should be able to see a populated timeline in the UI with fresh images from your camera and some object, people and face detections if there are any to detect. You can reference the Quick Start Guide for instructions on starting and stopping the Ambianic Edge docker image. Camera Configuration Cameras are some of the most common sources of input data for Ambianic.ai pipelines. Ambianic.ai is typically connected to IP Network cameras, but you can also connect a local embedded web cam or USB connected camera. You can set uri to a local path such as /dev/video0 to use a working usb webcam or picamera in case you have a picamera connected to Raspbery Pi connector. Connecting a local Web USB camera A laptop camera or USB camera on linux or mac can be used just providing a working reference to the video device, eg. /dev/video0 Connecting a Picamera To use a Picamera connected to the camera connector on the Raspberry Pi (usually available in the middle of the board) Ensure also your setup have the camera enabled and provides enough GPU memory for processing frames. The following script will take care of it for you: # Enable camera sudo raspi-config nonint do_camera 1 # Allocate GPU to camera: if ! grep -Fq \"gpu_mem=\" /boot/config.txt; then echo \"gpu_mem=256\" | sudo tee -a /boot/config.txt fi In a tipical setup your /boot/config.txt should contain something like this at the end [all] start_x=1 gpu_mem=256 Then update your configuration to point to the right source picamera: uri: picamera type: video live: true Connecting over HTTP or RTSP Another option is to stream your local camera over HTTP or RTSP. VLC is one of the most popular and easy to use apps for that. Here is how you can turn your local webcam into an IP streaming camera. The streaming URL shared by VLC is the input source URI for the Ambianic.ai configuration file. How to find the URI for your camera If you don't have experience configuring surveillance cameras, it can be tricky to find the URI. We are working on a camera Plug-and-Play feature in Ambianic to make it easier to discover and connect to your cameras. Keep an eye for release news. In the meanwhile, you have several options: First, check your camera manufacturer's documentation whether it supports still image URL over HTTP or video streaming over RTSP. Most IP cameras do, but not all. If your camera is ONVIF standard conformant, then you will have access to HTTP camera images and RTSP video stream. You can use the ONVIF Search Tool to check if your camera is listed as conformant. You can then use a tool such as ONVIF Device Manager to auto discover your IP camera and show you its RTSP and HTTP URI. Here is a quick How-To . A more detailed post on this tool is also available here . Your camera manufacturer will likely have an online resource describing how to determine its RTSP address. It would look something like this one . There is also an online directory where you can search for the RTSP URI of many camera brands. Using still image source instead of a video stream for your camera URI In many cases processing 1 frame per second is sufficient frequency to detect interesting events in your environment. It is usually more CPU and network resource efficient to use a still image source instead of live RTSP stream for 1fps. This approach allows Ambianic.ai Edge to pull from the camera another image snapshot when it is ready as opposed to streaming which pushes constantly media updates that Edge may or may not be ready to process. All you have to do to use a still image source from your camera is to locate the specific image URI as described above and plug it in the corresponding source section of the config.yaml file. Here is what it would look like: front_door_camera: uri: http://192.168.86.29/cgi-bin/api.cgi?cmd=Snap&channel=0&rs=wuuPhkmUCeI9WG7C&user=admin&password=****** type: image live: true In the example above the URI points to a still jpg sample from the camera. Ambianic Edge will continuously poll this URI approximately once per second (1fps). Sensitive config information Since camera URIs often contain credentials, we recommend that you store such values in secrets.yaml . Ambianic Edge will automatically look for and if available prepend secrets.yaml to config.yaml . That way you can share config.yaml with others without compromising privacy sensitive parameters. You can use standard YAML anchors and aliases in config.yaml to reference YAML variables defined in secrets.yaml . They will resolve after the files are merged into one. An example valid entry in secrets.yaml for a camera URI, would look like this: secret_uri_front_door_camera: &secret_uri_front_door_camera 'rtsp://user:pass@192.168.86.111:554/Streaming/Channels/101' # add more secret entries as regular yaml mappings It can be then referenced in config.yaml as follows: front_door_camera: uri: *secret_uri_front_door_camera Notification settings Ambianic edge can be configured to instantly alerts users when a detection occurs. Notifications are a feature of the save_detections element. Every time a timeline event is saved along with its contextual data, a notification can be fired to a number of supported channels such as email, sms, or a local smart home hub such as Home Assistant ( hassios://{host}/{access_token} ). Notification providers are first configured at a system level using the following syntax: notifications: catch_all_email: include_attachments: true providers: - mailto://userid:pass@domain.com - hassios://{host}/{access_token} alert_fall: providers: - mailto://userid:pass@domain.com - json://hostname/a/path/to/post/to Notice that the catch_all_email provider template uses the include_attachments attribute. Email notifications to this provider will include timeline event attachments such as captured images. On the other hand the alert_fall does not use the include_attachments attribute. Notifications sent through this provider will include the essential event information, but no attachments. In order to include attachments via alert_fall , just add the include_attachments: true element. For a full list of supported providers and config syntax, take a look at the official apprise documentation . Apprise is a great notifications library that ambianic edge uses and sponsors. Once the system level notification providers are configured, they can be referenced within save_detection elements as in the following example: pipelines: # Pipeline names could be descriptive, e.g. front_door_watch or entry_room_watch. area_watch: ... - detect_falls: # look for falls ... - save_detections: # save samples from the inference results positive_interval: 10 idle_interval: 600000 notify: # notify a thirdy party service providers: - alert_fall Each time a detection event is saved, a corresponding notification will be instantly fired. Other configuration settings The rest of the configuration settings are for advanced developers. If you feel ready to dive into log files and code, you can experiement with different AI models and pipeline elements. Otherwise leave them as they are. Using AI Accelerator Ambianic Edge will use the Google Coral TPU accelerator if one is available on the system. Note: The default docker compose configuration for Ambianic Edge checks whether a USB attached Coral is running on /dev/bus/usb . You may need to adjust that if the TPU is attached to a different file system directory. Coral is a powerful TPU that can speed up inference 5-10 times. However AI inference is only part of all the functions that execute in an Ambianic Edge pipeline. Video decoding and formatting also takes substantial amount of processing time. Overall we've seen Coral to improve performance 30-50% on a realistic Raspberry Pi 4 deployment with multiple simultaneous pipelines pulling images from multiple cameras and processing these images with multiple inference models. If you don't have a Coral device available, no need to worry for now. Raspberry Pi 4 is quite powerful. It comfortably handles 3 simultaneous HD camera sourced pipelines with approximately 1-2 frames per second (fps). An objects or person of interest would normally show up in one of your cameras for at least one second, which is enough time to be registered and processed by Ambianic Edge on a plain RPI4.

In the section below: front_door_camera: uri: <your camera> Replace <your camera> with your camera still image snapshot URI (recommended). For example: front_door_camera: uri: http://192.168.86.29/cgi-bin/api.cgi?cmd=Snap&channel=0&rs=wuuPhkmUCeI9WG7C&user=admin&password=****** type: image live: true Or you can alternatively plug-in the camera video streaming RTSP URI. For example: front_door_camera: uri: rtsp://admin:password@192.168.1.99/media/video1 type: video live: true Only use RTSP if you run high end hardware and use AI inference in your pipelines that needs video and/or audio data instead of still images. Make sure that the HTTP URI points to a valid image. You can test by simply putting the URI in your web browser. You should see a current snapshot of live camera capture. If you choose to use an RTSP URI, then you can test that with a tool like VLC . The parameter live: true indicates that this is a continuous stream without a predetermined end. Therefore Ambianic Edge should do whatever it can to continuously pull media and recover from interruptions caused by network or other glitches. Now save the file and restart the docker image. Within a few moments you should be able to see a populated timeline in the UI with fresh images from your camera and some object, people and face detections if there are any to detect. You can reference the Quick Start Guide for instructions on starting and stopping the Ambianic Edge docker image.","title":"Pipeline Configuration"},{"location":"users/configure/#camera-configuration","text":"Cameras are some of the most common sources of input data for Ambianic.ai pipelines.

We are working on a camera Plug-and-Play feature in Ambianic to make it easier to discover and connect to your cameras. Keep an eye for release news. In the meanwhile, you have several options: First, check your camera manufacturer's documentation whether it supports still image URL over HTTP or video streaming over RTSP. Most IP cameras do, but not all. If your camera is ONVIF standard conformant, then you will have access to HTTP camera images and RTSP video stream. You can use the ONVIF Search Tool to check if your camera is listed as conformant. You can then use a tool such as ONVIF Device Manager to auto discover your IP camera and show you its RTSP and HTTP URI. Here is a quick How-To . A more detailed post on this tool is also available here . Your camera manufacturer will likely have an online resource describing how to determine its RTSP address. It would look something like this one . There is also an online directory where you can search for the RTSP URI of many camera brands.","title":"How to find the URI for your camera"},{"location":"users/configure/#using-still-image-source-instead-of-a-video-stream-for-your-camera-uri","text":"In many cases processing 1 frame per second is sufficient frequency to detect interesting events in your environment. It is usually more CPU and network resource efficient to use a still image source instead of live RTSP stream for 1fps. This approach allows Ambianic.ai Edge to pull from the camera another image snapshot when it is ready as opposed to streaming which pushes constantly media updates that Edge may or may not be ready to process. All you have to do to use a still image source from your camera is to locate the specific image URI as described above and plug it in the corresponding source section of the config.yaml file. Here is what it would look like: front_door_camera: uri: http://192.168.86.29/cgi-bin/api.cgi?cmd=Snap&channel=0&rs=wuuPhkmUCeI9WG7C&user=admin&password=****** type: image live: true In the example above the URI points to a still jpg sample from the camera. Ambianic Edge will continuously poll this URI approximately once per second (1fps).","title":"Using still image source instead of a video stream for your camera URI"},{"location":"users/configure/#sensitive-config-information","text":"Since camera URIs often contain credentials, we recommend that you store such values in secrets.yaml . Ambianic Edge will automatically look for and if available prepend secrets.yaml to config.yaml . That way you can share config.yaml with others without compromising privacy sensitive parameters. You can use standard YAML anchors and aliases in config.yaml to reference YAML variables defined in secrets.yaml . They will resolve after the files are merged into one. An example valid entry in secrets.yaml for a camera URI, would look like this: secret_uri_front_door_camera: &secret_uri_front_door_camera 'rtsp://user:pass@192.168.86.111:554/Streaming/Channels/101' # add more secret entries as regular yaml mappings It can be then referenced in config.yaml as follows: front_door_camera: uri: *secret_uri_front_door_camera","title":"Sensitive config information"},{"location":"users/configure/#notification-settings","text":"Ambianic edge can be configured to instantly alerts users when a detection occurs. Notifications are a feature of the save_detections element. Every time a timeline event is saved along with its contextual data, a notification can be fired to a number of supported channels such as email, sms, or a local smart home hub such as Home Assistant ( hassios://{host}/{access_token} ). Notification providers are first configured at a system level using the following syntax: notifications: catch_all_email: include_attachments: true providers: - mailto://userid:pass@domain.com - hassios://{host}/{access_token} alert_fall: providers: - mailto://userid:pass@domain.com - json://hostname/a/path/to/post/to Notice that the catch_all_email provider template uses the include_attachments attribute. Email notifications to this provider will include timeline event attachments such as captured images. On the other hand the alert_fall does not use the include_attachments attribute. Notifications sent through this provider will include the essential event information, but no attachments. In order to include attachments via alert_fall , just add the include_attachments: true element. For a full list of supported providers and config syntax, take a look at the official apprise documentation . Apprise is a great notifications library that ambianic edge uses and sponsors. Once the system level notification providers are configured, they can be referenced within save_detection elements as in the following example: pipelines: # Pipeline names could be descriptive, e.g. front_door_watch or entry_room_watch. area_watch: ... - detect_falls: # look for falls ... - save_detections: # save samples from the inference results positive_interval: 10 idle_interval: 600000 notify: # notify a thirdy party service providers: - alert_fall Each time a detection event is saved, a corresponding notification will be instantly fired.","title":"Notification settings"},{"location":"users/configure/#other-configuration-settings","text":"The rest of the configuration settings are for advanced developers.

Note: The default docker compose configuration for Ambianic Edge checks whether a USB attached Coral is running on /dev/bus/usb . You may need to adjust that if the TPU is attached to a different file system directory. Coral is a powerful TPU that can speed up inference 5-10 times. However AI inference is only part of all the functions that execute in an Ambianic Edge pipeline. Video decoding and formatting also takes substantial amount of processing time. Overall we've seen Coral to improve performance 30-50% on a realistic Raspberry Pi 4 deployment with multiple simultaneous pipelines pulling images from multiple cameras and processing these images with multiple inference models. If you don't have a Coral device available, no need to worry for now. Raspberry Pi 4 is quite powerful. It comfortably handles 3 simultaneous HD camera sourced pipelines with approximately 1-2 frames per second (fps). An objects or person of interest would normally show up in one of your cameras for at least one second, which is enough time to be registered and processed by Ambianic Edge on a plain RPI4.","title":"Using AI Accelerator"},{"location":"users/configure/#configuration-questions","text":"If you are having difficulties with configuration settings, feel free to ask your question in the community discussion forum or our public slack channel .","title":"Configuration Questions"},{"location":"users/custom-ai-apps/","text":"Installing and Running Custom AI Apps Examples of custom apps Where to get custom apps How to install and run","title":"Installing and Running Custom AI Apps"},{"location":"users/custom-ai-apps/#installing-and-running-custom-ai-apps","text":"Examples of custom apps Where to get custom apps How to install and run","title":"Installing and Running Custom AI Apps"},{"location":"users/edge-pairing/","text":"Establishing initial connection (pairing) between Ambianic UI and Ambianic Edge devices Upon starting the Ambianic UI (Progressive Web App) for the first time, it will automatically start looking in the background for an Ambianic Edge device on your own local network.
